  <p><strong>Could you describe your experience and
      relationship with the river?</strong></p>

  <p>So, the river is, about I would say a mile from my
    house. I live in Mid-South Gate , downtown area South Gate. So the most,
    I've biked it once but I thought it was scary because it's very dark and
    there's not a lot of access points so you'll go in in certain ways but then
    you have to go really far to be able to go back out. So I kind of didn’t do
    that after that. That's like the one experience and then besides that, I
    always pass it to get into the Downe area. So I mean we know the L.A. River
    is there but it's kind of like part of our daily transit rather than our
    daily lifestyle.</p>

  <p><strong>What do you think the purpose of the restoration
      efforts is?</strong> </p>

  <p>I want, well I think the goal would be to make it a
    green space. Where people can congregate and they could actually put it to
    use. I know one thing that would be pretty cool is if people could actually
    canoe on it. That would be really nice. Or just people can like actually
    access it, you know? Make it, like put lights so it's not so scary. Yeah. I
    mean a river is supposed to be like pretty you know, nature. That would be a
    pretty good goal. </p>

  <p><strong>What do you think of the current efforts?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>So, me being involved with L.A. Waterkeeper kind of
    shows me what's happening. I mean, I get a deeper understanding of the
    movements and what's being talked about. But I don't know if everyone in the
    South Gate community is aware that the restoration is even happening. So, I
    think that was one thing that I would want people to do. Maybe more outreach
    about like I like to go surveying when I can. I feel like maybe when you're
    asking people they're not even aware of the fact that it's being restored.
    But, I hope it works out. I hope it's successful. </p>

  <p><strong>What are your opinions of climate change and flood
      control in parts of the L.A. River?</strong> </p>

  <p>Same thing I'm thinking. You know a hundred years
    rain is coming. So I feel like people will have to be more aware of it. It's
    like things, since it's not happening immediately, people are not taking
    action. But it’s going to be too late to take action if it's already
    happening. I think again more awareness and people like bringing the cause
    to them and explaining it could be a possibility. </p>
