        <p class="standfirst">Four months after the Woolsey Fire, community
          members and environmental organizations, like Mountains Restoration
          Trust (MRT), remain steadfast to revitalize the mountains. While
          wildfires have been a recurring part of the Santa Monica Mountains
          since their inception some 2 million years ago, this recent fire was
          the largest in recorded history. </p>
        <small class="p-author byline">by Kate Eplboim
        <time>February 4, 2019.</time></small>

        <h2>Vital Facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The 13-day fire claimed 3 lives and displace roughly 250,000 people.</li>
          <li>96,949 acres were burned, including 150 acres at MRT’s LA Sierra Preserve. </li>
          <li>1,643 structures were lost, including MRT’s nursery operations.</li>
          <li>Estimates of the cost caused by the wildfire have been pegged in the upwards of billions.</li>
          <li>The Camp and Woolsey Fires produced approximately 5.5 million tons of CO2, which corresponds to around 15% of all California emissions.</li>
          <li>Within the week, air quality in California surpassed world health standards by 60 times. </li>
          <li>Roughly 47% of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA) was burned.</li>
          <li>2 of the 13 NPS-collared mountain lions perished. </li>
          <li>Surface erosion in Woolsey-impacted areas will increase by 24-fold for a 2-year recurrence storm event, 10-fold for a 10-year recurrence storm event. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>As we reflect on the Woolsey Fire and our wildfires of past and future, we have reconvened the experts from the MRT &amp; Conrad H. Hilton Foundation’s Community Halls to share their knowledge about the matter. </p>

        <h3>Interviews</h3>

        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT:</strong> What are the major causes and drivers of wildfires in the Santa Monica Mountains?</h4>


        <img class="avatar float" src="img/Philip+Rundel.jpg" alt="Phil Rundel">
        <p><strong>Dr. Phil Rundel, distinguished Professor of Biology at
            UCLA’s Department of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology</strong></p>
          <p>Virtually all recent fires in the Santa Monica Mountains have a human
          cause, either direct or indirect. Down or arcing power lines caused
          by wind have been the ignition events causing several recent fires.
          Motorcycles or cars with a hot muffler driving over dry grass can be
          a cause. Arson is rare but has occurred. Whatever the ignition
          source, hot dry Santa Anas make fires difficult to control. Drought
          conditions in recent years has caused dieback in chaparral shrubs and
          increased flammability. The same is true of invasive annual grasses,
          which can lengthen the length of fire season.</p>



        <p>Dr. Rundel recommends visiting <a href="http://www.californiachaparral.org ">California
            Chaparral Institute</a> to learn more about fire ecology in the
          Southern CA. </p>



        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT:</strong> What and where do wildfires burn in the Santa
          Monica Mountains?</h4>


          <img class="avatar float" src="img/marti-witter.jpg" alt="Marti Witter">
        <p><strong>Dr. Marti Witter, National Park Service Fire Ecologist</strong></p>

          <p>Fire burns all fuel types &#8211; grasslands, woodlands (oak
          woodlands and riparian woodlands), shrublands (coastal sage and
          chaparral) and homes (the highest fuel load type). </p>



        <p>The below maps give an illustrated, pictoral answer to where fire
          burns in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area &#8211;
          everywhere, but some areas more than others. The area with the most
          fires are the Cheeseboro/Liberty Canyon/Malibu Canyon corridor. If
          you look at the decadal fire maps you will see that the area of the
          Woolsey Fire hadn&#8217;t burned since the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s,
          but it is an area that has seen a lot of large fires in the past. </p>



        <p><a href="http://www.mountainstrust.org/gallery/npsfiremaps/">NPS
            Fire History Maps</a></p>



        <p>Large fires are not new and have occurred since we have been keeping
          records (1925) and even before then which we know from historic
          newspaper reports and paleontological data (charcoal deposits). The
          decadal fire maps show this really well. All of our large fires have
          occurred under weather and fuel conditions of low humidity, low fuel
          moisture and high winds (usually in the fall, but the 2013 Springs
          Fire was in May and the drought created conditions that were
          equivalent to those that normally occur only in fall). </p>



        <p>The only difference with the Woolsey Fire conditions to that of
          other fires was: four years of drought preceding Woolsey, causing a
          lot of SHRUB dieback &#8211; note that dead trees do not carry fire
          in the same way as dead shrubs &#8211; &nbsp;and a longer than
          typical 2-3 days Santa Ana wind event. The 2017 Thomas Fire also had
          a record setting Santa Ana event duration which was 10 days. </p>

            Consortium</a> </p>

        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT:</strong> What role do wildfires play in ecosystem
          health?</h4>


          <img class="avatar float" src="img/brad-shaffer.jpg" alt="Brad Shaffer">
        <p><strong>Brad Shaffer, Director of UCLA La Kretz Center for CA
            Conservation</strong></p>
            <p>Biological communities go through natural
          successions over time—grasslands often establish quickly, shrublands
          follow and outcompete grasses, and ultimately trees and forests of
          different heights come to dominate a landscape. Those successions
          occur in the absence of disturbance, and they are part of the natural
          dynamics of ecological communities. However, disturbance helps keep
          all of those species alive and functioning, and fire is a major
          source of disturbance. Many of the shrub communities that dominate
          Southern California will transition to oak woodland if they never
          burn, but fire keeps them from attaining the so-called climax
          community of mature trees. Given that this process of patchy, random
          disturbance from fire has gone on for millions of years, certain
          plants and animals have evolved to specialize on those post-burn
          conditions. Black-backed woodpecker is a northern species that
          specializes on insects that themselves specialize on dead trees
          following wildfires— without fires, the woodpeckers, their insect
          prey, and certain species of plants would all go extinct. The key,
          from an ecological and ecosystem health perspective, is to have
          moderate fires that occasionally burn patches of landscapes, leaving
          different patches in different stages of succession supporting the
          species that specialize on those conditions.</p>



        <p>Brad recommends two websites (<a href="https://www.freshfromflorida.com/Divisions-Offices/Florida-Forest-Service/Wildland-Fire/Prescribed-Fire/The-Natural-Role-of-Fire">Fresh
            from Florida’s &#8211; The Natural Role of Fire</a>, and <a href="http://www.landscope.org/article/FL/life/fire_in_florida/">Landscope’s
            &#8211; Fire in Florida</a>) that help emphasize the importance of
          wildfire, pointing to Florida’s wiregrass-longleaf pine community, a
          threatened ecosystem that depends on very frequent (every 1-3 years)
          fire. Whether those fires are in the form of controlled burns of
          wildfires doesn’t matter, just so it burns very frequently. </p>



        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT: </strong>Why is chaparral, the dominant habitat of the
          Santa Monica Mountains, so vital to our local ecosystem and safety?
          </h4>

          <img class="avatar float" src="img/stephen-davis.jpg" alt="Steve Davis">
        <p><strong>Steve Davis, Professor of Biology at Pepperdine University</strong></p>
          <p>Chaparral and coastal sage scrub vegetation are vital to our local
          ecosystems for the goods and services they provide humans, wildlife,
          and our mountainous watersheds. Chaparral and coastal sage scrub are
          low maintenance, requiring no irrigation or fertilization, yet they
          hold up our rugged hillsides. They enable animal life through oxygen
          production, nutrient transformations, and solar energy capture. They
          provide humans food, fiber, fuel, and medicine. These distinctive
          vegetation types deter global warming, desertification, and soil
          erosion. In short, they help sustain our life support system on
          earth. </p>



        <p>To find more information on the numerous ways our local ecosystems
          impacts us, Davis suggested Peter Raven&#8217;s article &#8220;<a
            href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ppp3.3">Saving
            Plants, Saving Ourselves</a>.” </p>



        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT:</strong> What are the most effective actions and
          initiatives communities can take to make their homes and
          neighborhoods wildfire safe?</h4>


          <img class="avatar float" src="img/j-lopez.jpg" alt="J. Lopez">
        <p><strong>J. Lopez, Assistant Chief of the County of Los Angeles Fire
            Department in the Prevention Services Bureau</strong></p>
            <p>The ability
          of your home to survive a wildfire depends on its construction
          materials and the quality of the “defensible space” surrounding it.
          Windblown embers from a wildfire will find the weak link in your
          home’s fire protection scheme and gain the upper hand because of a
          small, overlooked or seemingly inconsequential factor. However, there
          are measures you can take to safeguard your home from wildfire.</p>


        <section class="precautions">
        <h4 class="tips">Hardening your Home</h4>
        <p>Hardening the home is a crucial process in protecting one’s property
          from wildfire damage. Hardening refers to the process of fireproofing
          one’s house or other structures through the use of various flame
          retardant materials. Flying embers can destroy homes up to a mile
          from a wildfire. “Harden” your home now before a fire starts by using
          ember-resistant building materials.</p>


        <h4 class="tips">Creating and maintaining defensible space</h4>
        <p>Preventing conditions where fire can travel from adjacent fuels,
          through an ornamental landscape to your structure, is the key to
          creating defensible space. Fire spreads through convection,
          conduction, radiation, or embers. Proper maintenance of ornamental
          vegetation reduces ember production, fire propagation, intensity, and
          duration of the approaching flames.</p>
        </section>


        <p>To find more information on how to harden your home, Asst. Chief
          Lopez recommends using the “<a href="https://fire.lacounty.gov/ready-set-go.pdf">Ready!
            Set! Go! Program</a>”.</p>



        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT:</strong> What post-fire toxins should humans be most
          concerned about? What do we do about them?</h4>


          <img class="avatar float" src="img/zhu-yifang.jpg" alt="">
        <p><strong>Dr. Yifang Zhu, Dean of the UCLA Fielding School of Public
            Health</strong></p>
            <p>Houses, cars and other materials are
          burned,they release toxic fumes into the environment in their wake
          known as PAH*, this toxin can be produced after burning coal,
          garbage, oil, and wood to name a few. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL080473">HERE</a>
          is a recent study showing after 14 months, no difference was observed
          for wildfire-derived PAHs and trace elements in indoor environments</p>



        <p>Unfortunately, I could not find any other study specifically
          addressing wildfire&#8217;s impact on indoor environments within 14
          months. But more research has been done on structure fire. Ash from
          burned structures is generally more hazardous than forest ash.
          Depending on what materials were burned, post-fire toxicants may
          include PAHs, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds, etc. </p>



        <p>Dr. Zhu’s recommends the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/EPO/Pages/BI_Natural-Disasters_Wildfires.aspx">California
            Department of Public Health&#8217;s wildfire page</a> to learn more
          about the protecting public during and after wildfires.</p>

        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT:</strong> What does the landscape recovery/regeneration
          look like post-fire?</h4>


          <img class="avatar float" src="img/Suzanne-Goode.jpg" alt="">
        <p><strong>Suzanne Goode, Natural Resource Program Manager for
            California’s Department of Parks &amp; Recreation for the district
            of Los Angeles</strong></p>
            <p>Post fire regeneration often starts prior
          to the first rains with visible growth on still-standing yucca
          plants. The first rains have already brought the germination of
          annual grasses and new growth of native perennial grasses, as well as
          the return of the wild cucumber. When the weather warms, if there has
          been sufficient rain, chemicals in the smoke will have infiltrated
          the soil to break the dormancy of fire-following annuals, with
          resulting spectacular displays of color from California poppies, wind
          poppies, lupines, phacelia, and many others. Short-lived perennials,
          such as bush poppies and chaparral bush mallow will also begin to
          grow. Seedlings of obligate seeding chaparral species, such as
          big-pod ceanothus and big-berry manzanita will also appear.
          Resprouting shrubs, such as chamise, laurel sumac, greenbark
          ceanothus, sagebrush and sage will be a foot or more tall by the end
          of the first growing season. The second year will continue to have
          post-fire wildflowers, though not quite as abundant as the first
          year, and the shrubs will have become more prominent. Oaks that were
          severely burned but still survived will exhibit sprouting along their
          branches. By the fourth year after the fire, the chaparral canopy
          will have begun to close, with only a few burned stems left to show
          evidence of the fire.</p>







        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT:</strong> Where can policy makers make the biggest
          differences to reduce the impact of future wildfires?</h4>


          <img class="avatar float" src="img/rick-halsey.jpg" alt="">
        <p><strong>Richard Halsey, the Director of the Chaparral Institute and
            author of <em>Fire, Chaparral, and Survival in Southern
              California</em></strong></p>
              <p>The traditional
          approach to wildfire protection is backward. It focuses on vegetation
          rather than what we want to protect – our homes and families. The
          nearly exclusive focus on vegetation management is not working in the
          wind-driven fires that cause all the devastation. We must look at the
          problem <em>from the house outward</em>, rather than from the
          wildland in. Homes burn because they are flammable and are built on
          fire-prone landscapes. Most structures ignite during wildfires <em>because
            of flying embers</em>that can travel a mile or
          more from the fire front. This is why so many families have lost
          their homes even though they have complied with defensible space
          regulations – their homes were still vulnerable to embers. This is
          why <em>the wildfire problem is a home ignition problem, not a
            wildfire control problem</em>. Therefore, to stop the destruction
          of our communities by wildfire, fire policy must focus on strategies
          that reduce the flammability of existing communities (ember-resistant
          vents, fire-resistant roofing and siding, and exterior sprinklers,
          <em>then 100</em> feet of defensible space) and prevent new ones from
          being built in very high fire hazard severity zones.</p>



        <p>Halsey said you can find more of his in-depth research and
          commentary at The Chaparral Institute website. MRT recommends reading
          Halsey’s book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Chaparral-Survival-Southern-California/dp/0932653693">Fire,
            Chaparral, and Survival in Southern California</a>”. </p>



        <h4 class="question"><strong>MRT: </strong>Where can we best innovate to minimize the
          future causes and/or devastation of wildfires in Southern California?
        </h4>


        <img class="avatar float" src="img/peter+kareiva.jpg" alt="">
        <p><strong>Peter Kareiva, the Director of UCLA Institute of the
            Environment &amp; Sustainability</strong></p>
            <p>Wildfires
          have always been part of Southern California, with climate change
          fires are different. Best practices for 1950 are likely not best
          practices in 2020, much less 2050. Not surprisingly there is a lot of
          research directed at improving our understanding of how wildfires
          spread so that the spread can be modeled and predicted in order to
          better direct fire containment efforts. At a less technical level a
          high priority is to revisit flammability, and ask to what extent does
          species composition influence the likelihood of ignition and rapid
          spread, after factoring out weather conditions. A third priority is
          rethinking restoration. Restoration implies returning to some
          previous condition. But with global warming accelerating more rapidly
          than anyone anticipated, we should consider our actions after a fire
          as rejuvenating nature so that it is resilient and thriving in
          tomorrow’s world, not yesterday’s world. What plants will thrive in
          Santa Monica mountains in 2050? Does that mean we favor some plants
          over others. Lastly, after every major fire we hear that every fire
          is different. And we also know that the plant communities and species
          in the Santa Monica are unique. We need to make sure our management
          guidance for mitigating fire risk is tailored to the Santa Monica’s
          and not borrowed from some other region of the state.</p>
