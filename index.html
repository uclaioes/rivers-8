    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As a part of the Environmental Science curriculum at UCLA’s Institute of Environment & Sustainability (IoES), we will research community surveys conducted as part of previous outreach efforts, by evaluating their comprehensiveness and efficacy, and conduct our own research on local relationships with the River and visions for its future. Our cohort consists of seven team members: Andrew Nguyen, Camila Tipan, Corey Ly, James Javelosa, Kamryn Kubose, Nathan Lopez, and Scott Brown. Partnering with our IoES advisor Liz Koslov and our client Melissa Von Mayrhauser of LA Waterkeeper, our research team will focus on assessing community perceptions of impacts caused by continuing and future development of the LA River. Particularly, we will explore the gaps between the current planning process, holistic river management, and community engagement.</p>
