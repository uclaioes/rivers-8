    <p class="standfirst">Exploring the gaps between current planning processes, holistic river management, and community engagement surrounding the Los Angeles River.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Running 51 miles through Southern California, the Los Angeles River serves as a hub of industry and innovation, and engages, albeit unconventionally, with the Los Angeles community.   In 1936 and 1938, the River experienced catastrophic flooding. Hundreds of lives were lost and millions of dollars accrued in damage. Due to it being a public safety hazard, the city enlisted the United States Army Corps of Engineers to  concretize the River. Portions of the River have been closed off to the public through fencing and signs, forcing the ideology that the River shouldn’t play an important factor in urban planning. Today it seems to serve one purpose: to divert stormwater runoff to the ocean as quickly as possible. However, many groups advocate returning the River to its foundational characteristics of a community asset. </p> 
     <p>The outlook on the River is changing. There are several projects and visions in different stages of completion that hope to revitalize the River. These projects include the Los Angeles River Greenway, the city’s Revitalization Master Master Plan, the County River Master Plan, Glendale Narrows Riverwalk, Taylor Yard, and the Lower Los Angeles River Revitalization Plan. A part of these plans include public outreach in the form of public meetings, surveys, and educational campaigns. While these efforts are commendable, there seems to be an exclusion of certain topics and communities. </p>

    <p>Partnering with our IoES advisor Liz Koslov and our client Melissa Von Mayrhauser of <a href="https://lawaterkeeper.org/">LA Waterkeeper</a>, our research team will focus on assessing community perceptions of impacts caused by continuing and future development of the LA River. Particularly, we will explore the gaps between the current planning process, holistic river management, and community engagement.</p>
