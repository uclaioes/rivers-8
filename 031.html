          <p><strong>James [00:00:01] So we&#8217;re students at UCLA and we&#8217;re conducting research. My name is James.</strong> </p>

          <p><strong>Camila [00:00:06] I&#8217;m Camilla.</strong> </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:00:07] And then.</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:00:09] My name is Joshua. </p>
          
          <p>Edelyn [00:00:11] Edelyn. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:00:11] Evelyn?</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Edelyn [00:00:11] Edelyn. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:00:11] Edelyn. OK. Nice to meet you guys. Yeah. So we&#8217;re doing research about the L.A. River. And so we kind of just wanted to talk to the people here. We&#8217;re kind of by the river who kind of use the river. So I guess if you guys didn&#8217;t like. Have you guys use the river before or like what&#8217;s your experience with the L.A. River.</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:00:35] It&#8217;s pretty pretty empty. That&#8217;s fine I guess you don&#8217;t really see. Um you know that many I guess crazy people down there. We haven&#8217;t been there lately but it&#8217;s pretty good. Yes. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:00:52] So when you when you have used the river like what specific activities you go to does anything specific or just.</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Edelyn [00:01:00] Skateboarding I tried taking my skateboard down there. Otherwise it&#8217;s not a good road its bumpy from all gravel not exactly. Right. I guess. You&#8217;re saying. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:01:14] Yeah. So are you familiar with what the city of Southgate and the L.A. City is trying to do with the river in terms of the projects that they have a plan coming up with the river.</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:01:28] With the river bed. I don&#8217;t think so I know the plans they&#8217;re having and I know for a while it&#8217;s just more security down there. But other than that, no I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing down there. </p>
          
          <p><strong>Camila [00:01:39] So you&#8217;ve seen a change in security would you say?</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:01:42] There was there was more patrols going down and they ended up adding I know like porta potties down under the bridge over there. They had a security ring there why common sense is sometimes necessary. But that&#8217;s it. Yeah. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:02:04] Is there anything you guys would want to see like built or done?</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:02:09] Done in the bed? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:02:13] OK. So you would say like you&#8217;re fine the way is?</strong></p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:02:16] Yeah very much fine like that. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:02:19] And then.</strong> </p>
          
          <p><strong>Camila [00:02:22] I don&#8217;t know if you guys know that the rivers used to kind of to control floods and stuff. I don&#8217;t know if you guys experienced any of that. Or you witnessed it super full. Do you have any safety concerns about flooding in the area and like really like living near the area.</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:02:40] I do live nearby. Um. It&#8217;s pretty good. I don&#8217;t really see anyone go down into the river when it&#8217;s flooded. I think I have seen them probably close up the gate. Stuff like that but other than that I think it&#8217;s I think it&#8217;s pretty fine. It seems like it&#8217;s gone like a comple days. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:03:00] Do you think with climate change like the river do you think has uh. Are you concerned about it over flooding or in terms of climate change? And extreme weather.</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:03:11] Probably not. Not really. No not really. I don&#8217;t see it overflooding or anything. Haven&#8217;t seen it get like this super high where it&#8217;s like blocking even the road to walk on and stuff. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:03:23] And I guess like if the city does like have plans to build more parks and more amenities like would you. Would you have any concern about that or like any worries?</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:03:36] No I don&#8217;t think so. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:03:40] And then I guess last question if you can describe the river in like one word what would you describe it as?</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Edelyn [00:03:54] Besides it&#8217;s it&#8217;s pretty safe. Just don&#8217;t go that night because there&#8217;s homeless people.</p>
          
          <p>Joshua [00:04:00] Calm I guess. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:04:07] That&#8217;s a good one.</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Edelyn [00:04:10] Yeah. </p>
          
          <p><strong>James [00:04:10] All right. I think that we hit all the marks all right. Thanks guys so much.</strong> </p>
          
          <p><strong>Camila [00:04:15] Enjoy.</strong> </p>
