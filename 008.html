    <p><strong>James [00:00] I guess you can tell us your name, where you are
            from?</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [00:05] Chris and I&#8217;m from Downey</p>

    <p><strong>James [00:07] Downey, ok. And what is your experience with the LA
            River, have you..what have you used the river for, like today
            you&#8217;re walking your dog. Is that what you mostly do?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Chris [00:18] Yeah I just let her walk.. I wanna say I don&#8217;t even
        go to the River that much. I just go here cuz its a bigger park than
        anywhere else. There&#8217;s a park near Downey and there&#8217;s a
        river down there but its not as big for her to run around in the grass.
        And honestly she just wants to lay in the grass but the river itself
        doesn&#8217;t mean anything to me. It&#8217;s not even a real river,
        it&#8217;s fake.</p>

    <p><strong>James [00:041] Yeah so kind of piggybacking off of that, the the
            city of South Gate and the city of La they kind of want to make it
            into a real River in that sense, and so there&#8217;s a lot of
            development projects upcoming with it. Are you familiar with any of
            what those are?</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [00:55] I&#8217;m not so tell me about it</p>

    <p><strong>James [00:57] Ok so the city is&#8230; basically they want
            to&#8230;kind of similar to this park, re-open up access to the
            river and use it as a community asset in terms of parks and
            recreational areas for community members to use.</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [01:14] That&#8217;d be nice.</p>

    <p><strong>James [01:15] Yeah and so if that were to happen, what would you
            say you would want to see built or developed here?</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [01:24] Honestly better parks more areas for the dogs because if
        you look at the other side of here and I actually saw several dogs on
        that side like over [there] they&#8217;ll let you but&#8230; they put a
        little, crappy little spot over there for the dogs and no one really
        even uses this area if you look at it, no one is ever here.</p>

    <p><strong>James [01:40] Yeah</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [01:41] So you just have a whole open grass that no one can ever
        really use. It looks nice but that&#8217;s about it</p>

    <p><strong>James [01:46] Okay and so that&#8217;s pretty much what you would
            hope for? Just recreational</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [01:51]` yeah because I only do it for my dog otherwise I&#8217;m
        working I don&#8217;t really care</p>

    <p><strong>James [01:55] Okay, and then&#8230;</strong></p>

    <p>[01:58] Oh shit! Come here! Oh! You asshole, come here! Bad Girl!</p>

    <p><strong>James [02:06] Strong dog!</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [02:08] She&#8217;s a puppy still, she saw like something. Sit!
        Come here! She got scared of that or something she ran away from it</p>

    <p><strong>James [02:18] No worries</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [02:19] Something scared her, sorry about that</p>

    <p><strong>Andrew [02:22] No, no, no</strong> </p>

    <p>Chris [02:22] Go ahead</p>

    <p><strong>James [02:22] Are you okay, do you need to collect
            yourself?</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [02:23] Nah Im okay</p>

    <p><strong>James [02:25] and so what was I just&#8230;develop okay like the
            development [some] cities are planning to do project what would you
            say is a big concern if they were to go through with some of the
            things like..</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [02:38] You know what I would like to see! More actually water!
        Yeah you know because its all grass and its nice and everything but the
        dogs like running in water in a water area. I would say having a closed
        area where they can have dogs run around. In an enclosed area, lest say
        they enclose this entire area and there&#8217;s a little pond. They
        don&#8217;t actually have this for dogs, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d
        like to see. It&#8217;s great thing they have the slides and all the
        stuff for the kids I think it&#8217;s great! But I don&#8217;t have kids
        so.</p>

    <p><strong>James [03:08] Okay, and then one of the biggest reasons why the
            LA River was concretized and made into this channel was that
            concerns of flooding. So part of our research is also to kind of
            gauge what concern level do community residents have in terms of the
            Rivers capacity to mitigate flooding for the community</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [03:35] you know honestly I&#8217;m not an engineer, i don&#8217;t
        know much about that stuff but all I know is every time we talk about
        the River you know that&#8217;s not a real river. C&#8217;mon yanno its
        concrete. It&#8217;s not a real river so we all laugh about it</p>

    <p><strong>James [03:50] Because right now the LA River is pretty good at
            keeping and maintaining flood control but do you think in the future
            in terms of climate change do you think the LA River would be able
            to handle that? Do you think that would be a concern?</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [04:06] I don&#8217;t know, you know I&#8217;m not sure you
        remember climate change but now it&#8217;s global warming but before it
        was global cooling, you know climate is always gonna be changing. They
        just change the terminology</p>

    <p><strong>James [04:16] Yeah</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [04:17] Did they just&#8230; honestly I think it&#8217;s more
        fear-mongering so people can make money off of it</p>

    <p><strong>James [04:21] Oh, interesting okay.</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [04:22] You know what I mean? Cuz when it was global cooling they
        tried to make money off of that. Once the temperature went up they
        changed it to global warming and then when it cools again they&#8217;re
        just gonna change the term, to and open term with everything.
        That&#8217;s just my thought on it</p>

    <p><strong>James [04:36] Alright</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [04:37] But it&#8217;s smart though, if I would make money off of
        that I would too</p>

    <p><strong>James [04:40] Ok and then&#8230;</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [04:41] Because the climate&#8217;s always gonna be changing just
        look at history you know?</p>

    <p><strong>James [04:48] Any final questions? Final thoughts?</strong></p>

    <p>Chris [04:51] No not really</p>

    <p><strong>James [04:52] Okay yeah alright thank you!</strong></p>
