    <p>Well. I mean, I
        understand what the city and the county and the state are trying to
        do. I understand that. And I think that in some cases it is a good
        idea. It&#39;s poor execution. Their thought process is good to help
        these struggling cities and to do these things. But what they&#39;re
        doing is not necessarily going to help. Doing a revitalization of the
        L.A. River and having people kayak down the L.A. River is not going to
        happen. I can almost guarantee that no one in their right mind would
        want to step foot in the L.A. River. OK. Not to mention that taking
        out the concrete and putting in green space and putting in parks and
        things like that. Great. But every city that borders the L.A. River is
        not exactly a good city. And it&#39;s just going to make. It&#39;s
        going to give the homeless people more places to stay. And it&#39;s
        going to give more drug use and drug sales and all that kind of stuff
        that&#39;s already happening in and around the L.A. River already.
        They want to help. And I get it. I think that that&#39;s great. But
        there&#39;s other ways that I think that they can do this instead of
        revitalizing or not revitalizing. The L.A. River was never nice to
        begin with. So it&#39;s mainly just a project to you know spend money
        that the that the federal government is giving them to do. And if
        that&#39;s what they have to use it for then I guess that&#39;s what
        they had to use it for. I&#39;m not going to see any benefit out of
        it. Where we are here this is just my office. Thi Is my work. I&#39;m
        not going to see any benefit of it. The L.A. River&#39;s right there.
        You know I know that but I&#39;m not sure exactly what they&#39;re
        planning on getting out of this whole project. They&#39;re also doing
        a lot of Section 8 housing locally here. Doing one right across the
        street from me. I&#39;m not excited about that. We already get a lot
        of homeless people that walk around here all the time. They damage
        property. They steal things. And that&#39;s what I think they should
        be doing more to help that than anything else. And I just don&#39;t
        think that it&#39;s going to do much. I mean I applaud their efforts I
        really do they&#39;re doing something. And I think that that&#39;s the
        right step to do. But spending all this money. To make a green space
        for people to go buy drugs and you know that&#39;s what they want to
        do it&#39;s what they want to do. </p>

    <p><strong>OK. So yeah so if. So you
            would say in your opinion the L.A. River restoration/revitalization
            should focus on solving the homeless and drug problems before
            putting
            in amenities.</strong></p>

    <p>I think doing this is
        going to escalate the problems. OK. It&#39;s going to give them more
        places for them to do what they need to do. Mm hmm. I think it&#39;s
        probably a good thing for the ecological system. The environmental
        science aspect of it I think is probably pretty good. I think what
        they&#39;re failing to understand is that the cities that are
        bordering this the L.A. River are, are notoriously not very good
        cities. Boyle Heights, Southgate, Lynwood, Paramount. You know
        they&#39;re not very good cities when it comes to a lot of this stuff.
        And if they&#39;re going to benefit from this and have a park.
        That&#39;s great. But if you look at all the parks in the cities right
        now. There really aren&#39;t any, and if there are. There&#39;s a lot
        of drug use a lot of homeless people live in there. All right
        that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. And I don&#39;t know what to do with
        the homeless population. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not a politician.
        I&#39;m not an urban planner I&#39;m an urban developer. I don&#39;t
        know. But when we have people wandering into our property and stealing
        things in the back. Which we have camera systems and I can show you
        all these people that come here. It&#39;s going to be a problem. And
        they&#39;re taking money from the from the government which is great.
        And obviously there are probably a lot of corrupt individuals that are
        just probably pocketing a lot of this money. Bell, Bell Gardens
        they&#39;ve all been accused of corruption in the past and they&#39;ve
        never had to do anything for it. And that&#39;s a problem. And I this
        being a problem just the same. Is getting money from the federal
        government. People making plans, overages, construction companies. I
        can see it already. I&#39;ve seen it too many times since I&#39;ve
        been here in and around this this area. I mean that&#39;s just my
        personal opinion. I know it&#39;s not exactly what you were hoping to
        hear today. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>A lot of people have
        brought up the issue of homelessness and drug use. And so it&#39;s a
        pretty common theme amongst people we&#39;ve talked to about their
        worry about it. So yeah that&#39;s kind of what we&#39;ve encountered
        so far.</p>
    <p>I think from an
        environmental standpoint environmental science standpoint it makes
        sense and knowing what you&#39;re doing now on the phone I didn&#39;t
        know your environmental science major. I didn&#39;t actually know what
        that was or what you did. I think from that standpoint it makes a lot
        of sense and I think that that&#39;s probably a good thing to do to
        get water back in the water table and this and that blah blah. But I
        don&#39;t know if you were born here or from Southern California but
        the L.A. River is nasty when it rains and it&#39;s just you can&#39;t
        go in the beach for a week yeah because of the water. </p>

    <p><strong>Yeah. I&#39;m actually not
            from the area.</strong></p>

    <p>Where are you from?
    </p>

    <p><strong>Guam.</strong> </p>
    <p>OK. Yeah that&#39;s a
        long way away. Quite a bit yeah right. </p>

    <p><strong>The L.A. the whole L.A.
            River is actually pretty pretty interesting to me and pretty
            interesting topic. So it&#39;s nice to hear like what the actual
            people on the ground I&#39;m thinking and we kind of jumped ahead
            but
            I guess you can just introduce yourself your business.</strong> </p>

    <p>Sure, my name is Steven
        Ball. I own a business here with my family. We manufacture roller
        skates in Southgate, California. We&#39;ve been in this facility since
        1980. Before that we were across the riverbed in Lynwood. And
        we&#39;ve been in business since 1937. &nbsp;It&#39;s a family
        business. It is a family business has been very good to my family over
        the years. The fourth generation of my family to be in this business.
        I&#39;m lucky. I don&#39;t take anything for granted. I work my ass
        off. I do everything that I can. And when you contacted me. Being you
        know a college graduate myself. I like to give back. I like to do
        things for for the education system as much as I can. My family or my
        my father unfortunately or fortunately went to USC. Yeah I did not. I
        got rejected. I end up playing baseball at a smaller school so I end
        up doing that little bit different around here though. So I&#39;ve
        been born and raised been here all my life. So I&#39;m the one that
        you probably want to talk to. These types of things that I&#39;ve been
        around it for my whole life. </p>

    <p><strong>So I guess like on a
            personal level. On a personal level like have you ever visited the
            river or use the river for anything?</strong> </p>

    <p>There&#39;s nothing to
        use in the river. There&#39;s like a couple of bike paths on top of
        it. I did that when I was a kid. I have not done it since and I
        don&#39;t particularly want to. Underneath all the the overhangs,
        It&#39;s where all the homeless people live. And when you come out
        here and you know the cops you call the cops they know that&#39;s
        where they live. That&#39;s where they stay. They don&#39;t even want
        to go over there because they don&#39;t want to go into their habitat
        or habitats not the right word. They don&#39;t want go into the
        territory because of the drug use and needles they don&#39;t want to
        get get hurt and I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t have a problem with that.
        But you know nobody wants to to face the facts. Nobody wants to
        confront the homeless people if you&#39;ve seen them. If you went on
        the 710 right over here there&#39;s a huge encampment on the side of
        the riverbed. Where are they going to go. What are you going to do
        with them when you when we bulldoze that thing and make a nice little
        park. Where are they going to go. Yeah you know I can see a
        recreational thing I can see doing something I can really see. As that
        as being a benefit but in the city of L.A. I just don&#39;t see that
        working. I see that working in Denver. I see that working in you know
        like. Austin you know in San Antonio in maybe like Chicago area but in
        Los Angeles with the gangs and stuff that we have here. It&#39;s just
        not I don&#39;t think it&#39;s you&#39;re going to get families to go
        there and picnic on a Saturday unfortunately. Yeah and kayaking down
        the L.A. River is by far the funniest thing I saw on that website. And
        I just kind of thought that was hilarious but maybe it&#39;s because
        I&#39;ve grown up with the river the way that it is. And anybody who
        goes in the rivers can get hepatitis. And anybody who&#39;s gone in
        the river who have in the past if you&#39;ve lived looked it up on the
        news there&#39;s always some kid every year when it rains. Got a
        boogie board trying to go to the beach on the L.A. River and he always
        has to be rescued. Yeah. Okay so that&#39;s the L.A. River to me. Yeah
        that&#39;s what I see. Now if they want to redo it and make it really
        nice and actually like a real river there&#39;s no real water. That
        like feeds the L.A. River it&#39;s just rain. So that&#39;s where you
        get all the mud and all the nasty stuff that that happens so when that
        happens in the L.A. River it does flood. It does get pretty high from
        time to time. I mean what&#39;s going to happen to our nice green
        space that we build. I don&#39;t want that to just to be decimated.
        Yeah. You know I&#39;ve seen what happens when rivers flood and trees
        and everything just gets eroded. You know it could be a potential
        problem. And I&#39;m sure that&#39;s where the environmental science
        major comes in at to figure all that stuff out. &nbsp;And I&#39;m not
        smart enough to do that. But I know or I feel like I would know about
        what&#39;s going to happen once this is done and my interpretation of
        it is no one&#39;s really going to use it okay. </p>

    <p><strong>That kind of jumps in to
            like the kind of final part of our topic discussion as the L.A.
            River.
            It is kind of the way it is the concrete channel because of like
            flood
            control. Do you feel like, are you concerned about its flood
            capacity
            and the flood control abilities in terms of moving forward in terms
            of
            climate change.</strong> </p>

    <p>I don&#39;t know. I
        don&#39;t see it. It&#39;s never overflowed as far as I know. I&#39;ve
        seen it pretty high. These last big rains we have. It&#39;s gotten
        pretty high but I&#39;ve seen it higher. So I don&#39;t really think
        that it&#39;s going to cause much of an issue where it overflows the
        banks. In my personal opinion but you know I don&#39;t know as far as
        climate change is concerned. I&#39;m not trying to say that that
        I&#39;m a skeptic of it. I&#39;m not. I think there needs to be more
        research involved in it. We can discuss ice ages in the past that
        didn&#39;t have CO2 gas emissions and all that stuff when I was in
        school. I heard a very interesting talk in my environmental science
        class and forget who the gentleman was that they got. But he came in
        and it was kind of sad what happened because in school you know
        you&#39;re not. You&#39;re. You&#39;re made to kind of think for
        yourself and to make decisions for yourself and to learn and to to
        learn that process that goes into the education system and how you get
        to graduating and becoming smarter. And I liked the fact that at my
        school we brought in some people who you may not see at &nbsp;a
        university. In most cases you see someone who would argue the other
        side. And I really liked that fact because we go down in the education
        system we always go one direction. We never really get to see
        everything. You know schools like Berkeley and things like that
        you&#39;re really only going down one side. And I like the fact that
        to at least address the other side&#39;s concern. There is there is
        climate change and I&#39;m not trying to say there&#39;s not climate
        change because there is clearly there is but I like listening to what
        someone else has to say about it. So for climate change. I don&#39;t
        know what&#39;s going to happen and nobody knows what&#39;s going to
        happen. You know it&#39;s our it&#39;s our Earth. It&#39;s our planet
        our weather systems. I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s really going to
        know exactly what&#39;s going to happen tomorrow. Anything can happen.
        But I think trying to do things and what we&#39;re doing trying to
        eliminate emissions and all this stuff I think is a is a great idea. I
        mean you can smell the air here is terrible. You know. But coming from
        some place like like Guam it&#39;s a lot cleaner and a lot clearer
        outside not as much smog going to Hawaii or things like that it&#39;s
        it&#39;s a lot better you know. But this is what we got for right now
        so we need trying to make the best that we can and in this situation
        you&#39;re trying to revitalize the riverbed. Probably a good idea.
        More water in the water table. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.
        You know I think that&#39;s a good thing but I&#39;m just concerned
        about the other side of it. </p>

    <p><strong>All right. I think. I
            think that&#39;s pretty much wraps up here. Yeah. Do you have
            anything
            to comment. </strong></p>

    <p><strong>No not really. I was just
            going to say that we&#39;re also doing like humans of the L.A. River
            kind of thing and if you&#39;re interested if we were to picture a
            you
            and just post it on our research, &nbsp;a little profile. </strong>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Yeah sure yeah. And if you
            want. Yeah. And any final thoughts from you are. Pretty much set at
            all. I mean. No not really. Yeah. I mean I didn&#39;t know anything
            about this. So I don&#39;t even know if I voted on this or not. But
            you know typically. You know it costs money and I&#39;ll vote for it
            but that&#39;s just me. OK yeah.</strong> </p>

    <p><strong>But now we&#39;re getting
            into a whole other side. Yeah. Which is you know poor use of
            government funds.</strong> </p>

    <p><strong>That was also something
            that I&#39;ve encountered OK. Some people like they&#39;re like well
            this isn&#39;t gonna be money to do all these things and this is
            going
            to come from taxes. So that&#39;s also another concern which is if
            that is a concern for you like we would also like to hear what you
            think about that.</strong></p>

    <p>What was the someone said
        something the other day was as a quote from Ronald Reagan. And it was
        something about like the government doesn&#39;t do whatever it just
        subsidizes everything. So it&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t actually make
        any money doesn&#39;t actually create something all you do is just
        spend. And spending money on this is probably a good thing. Although
        you probably drove up here and our roads are terrible. You know the
        roads are falling apart every time it rains a fall. I&#39;d rather
        have money go spent on that. There&#39;s supposed to be a gas tax. And
        all that money&#39;s supposed to go to roads. The money from the
        lottery is supposed to go to the schools. You know I don&#39;t see
        that. I see the schools cutting programs not increasing programs. They
        cut, when I was in high school they cut athletics from the middle
        schools. And giving kids something to do after school other than go
        home and play video games or do drugs is the important thing. And
        they&#39;re cutting those programs. I don&#39;t. And then you see. You
        know kids out on the streets or whatever and then I think it just
        perpetuates the problem. And you know say what you want about sports
        or extracurricular activities. They want a lot of kids just to go and
        learn and to be better at taking tests. Essentially, and I don&#39;t
        think taking a test really gives you a lot of like life skills and
        life lessons. I wasn&#39;t a very good test taker. I didn&#39;t go. I
        went to public school but I didn&#39;t get into a good college. I
        wasn&#39;t very smart. Okay. But I wasn&#39;t a very good test taker.
        And my dad didn&#39;t bribe the right people at USC to get me in. OK.
        &nbsp;I didn&#39;t do CRU. So you know. I just think that there&#39;s
        other things that the government could spend their money on to kind of
        help the situations and all they want to do is get elected because
        they make a two hundred thousand dollars a year being a senator. Yeah.
        And that&#39;s what they want to do. And then you get Bernie Sanders
        writing a book and makes a million dollars writing a book. What. I
        have no idea what that book was about. &nbsp;You know you get you get.
        Like you get Barack Obama and his wife. His wife wrote a book. About
        what being the first lady I guess. And you make millions of dollars on
        it. And. I don&#39;t understand. You become president. He&#39;s
        president for two years and now he&#39;s somewhat retired. I thought
        she wanted to be in public service. Yeah I thought she wanted to
        continue to give back. So you just quit. You&#39;re 40-50 years old.
        OK I&#39;m done. Yeah. Interesting. So I just think that it&#39;s kind
        of a. It&#39;s like a one way street for a lot of those guys. All they
        want is get paid. I don&#39;t think they really want to give back to
        the community. It&#39;s my personal opinion. All right. Well but prove
        me wrong. Yes. &nbsp;Let&#39;s build a river. </p>
