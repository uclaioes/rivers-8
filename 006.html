      <p><strong>James [00:03] so I guess I can&#8217;t talk about like I guess if you don&#8217;t mind saying your name and like I guess where you&#8217;re from?</strong></p>

      <p>Leticia [00:14] We&#8217;re actually residents, we’re Paramount residents. I just work for the city of South Gate</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [00:20] And are you familiar with what the LA River is or not really?</strong> </p>
      
      <p>Leticia [00:25] Um no I&#8217;m not really that familiar with it, I know where its at, I know where it&#8217;s located but no I don&#8217;t really know. </p>
      
      <p><strong>James [00:30] Would you say like you&#8217;ve you&#8217;ve, are you familiar with what the city of South Gate has tried to do with the LA River revitalization and restorations?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia [00:40] I don&#8217;t know actually.</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [00:44] Basically they&#8217;re like trying to open up access and create recreational facilities like [South Gate Park] but adjacent to the river. What would you think you would want to see out of that, personally what would you think you would use it for?</strong> </p>
      
      <p>Leticia [01:02] So what is the reason why they they&#8217;re gonna try to do that?</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [01:07] So a lot of the reasons why, is the city wants to create more park space more recreational space, but at the same time there&#8217;s been a lot of investment like in</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>other parts of the river like in the northern section of the river. The city of South Gate and other [South East LA] cities located near the river kind of like want to do the same thing.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia [01:29] Oh.. </p>
      
      <p><strong>James [01:31] A lot of it is like creating like habitat for [wildlife] and [possibly] remove the concrete on the river.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia [01:44] They want to remove what I&#8217;m sorry?</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [01:46] The concrete, that&#8217;s ideally what they want to do and that&#8217;s like the [end goal] they&#8217;ve been trying to get to and so a lot of times in nearby communities [the city] is trying to reach out to people who live nearby and see what they want.</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>James [02:02] Since you don&#8217;t really know much about that, what ways do you think the city can improve…</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia [02:08] to let people know like the community, how will they voice that? I just feel like they can in voice it in pretty much, maybe set up I don&#8217;t know like workshops, educational workshops, or during the city hall meetings. They could go voice that, what [it] can be, what&#8217;s the benefits. I know there&#8217;s a pros and cons to that I&#8217;m sure but I mean that&#8217;s how they would really go about it within the community because that&#8217;s you know they can put it out on the paper maybe social media. I mean not everyone is computer savvy but whoever is you know, it&#8217;s good. </p>
      
      <p><strong>James [02:51] A lot of times with development of projects [like these], citizens are concerned about like&#8230;</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia [03:00] The funding</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [03:02] Yeah the funding and possible gentrification and things like that. Do you have any issues particularly [for] yourself like concerning? If [the restoration] were to happen, what would be like a concern for you?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia [03:19] So a concern can be&#8230; I would fear it would just be the funding just because it is tax&#8230;</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [03:26] Okay.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia [03:27] Tax money, yes! I mean if you, usually when you know citizens want to, we want to be sure that it is a good project and it&#8217;s gonna be beneficial their tax money is gonna be for a good cause.</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [03:39] Okay.</strong> </p>
      
      <p>Leticia [03:40] If not then it&#8217;s not.</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [03:46] I&#8217;m sorry your name again?</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia [03:47] My name is Leticia Nunez.</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [03:53] My name is James again, thank you so much</strong></p>
      
      <p>[shakes hand]</p>
      
      <p>Leticia [03:54] Oh! I have been having food I hope you don&#8217;t mind!</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [03:56] It&#8217;s ok!</strong> </p>
      
      <p>Leticia [05:57] All right, you have a good one.</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [03:58] And you too!</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>James [04:01] I forgot to ask one more question.. one of the reasons why the LA River is the way it is because&#8230; why the river was concretized was because of flooding. So do do you share that concern with the river and do you think climate change should affect some of the decisions about the way they the river should be used?</strong> </p>
      
      <p>Leticia [04:28] The River, you know how its a home for a lot of homeless. You know what I should&#8217;ve told [you], how are they gonna go about that? With the homeless, will there be a place to direct them? Just because they need that type of resource.</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [04:43] I&#8217;ve also talked to some other people and that is their concern with any of the projects.</strong> </p>
      
      <p>Leticia [04:49] That&#8217;s their home</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [04:52] People I&#8217;ve talked to, if they do create a park, they are worried the homeless will cause trouble or..</strong></p>
      
      <p>Leticia’s Husband [05:03] They&#8217;re gonna be there camped out.</p>
      
      <p>Leticia [05:07] I think if they are going to do that kind of renovation or expansion then they should have somewhere to redirect them, the homeless.</p>
      
      <p>Leticia Husband [05:17] Or they can keep it gated</p>
      
      <p>Leticia [05:21] But then you&#8217;re taking them out of there, and of course they are gonna make it their new home because they were not guided to where they can get help. We are taking them out of where they call home and you&#8217;re gonna place a park for instance, of course they are gonna make it their home. Now if we direct them somewhere, where they can get help, housing, or whatever&#8230; then they won&#8217;t be there in the park</p>
      
      <p><strong>James [05:47] Okay all right thank you so much! This is really helpful!</strong></p>
