      <p><strong>James [00:00] yeah so I guess you could start off by saying your name and like where you&#8217;re from about yourself [that] kind of thing</strong></p>

<p>Olivia [00:12] My name is Olivia Veda I&#8217;m from Mexico I have three kids. Two of them they go to CSUN and one South Gate High School in tenth grade. And yes I&#8217;m not working, staying home. </p>

<p><strong>James [00:33] So our research is about the LA River and so do you have any experiences with that or have you ever used the river before</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [00:45] Mm no </p>

<p><strong>James [00:46] Okay</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [00:47] It&#8217;s very dangerous, a lot of people in the river bank, the homeless people, the homeless people</p>

<p><strong>James [00:56] Okay. So are you familiar with what the city hopes to do with the river in terms of redeveloping the river</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [01:01] Uh huh, and they, they will make another park? </p>

<p><strong>James [01:12] Do you..if they were to do other projects what would you want to see</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [01:17] In the park? </p>

<p><strong>James [01:19] yeah or like other amenities or facilities</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [01:23] I want more homes for the homeless for security</p>

<p><strong>James [01:30] For safety?</strong></p>

<p>Olivia [01:31] The safety, and more&#8230; uh&#8230;homes for the people that can&#8217;t afford the rent</p>

<p><strong>James [01:43] Affordable housing?</strong></p>

<p>Olivia [01:44] Affordable housing.</p>

<p>Olivia [01:47] I wanna park for those </p>

<p><strong>James [01: 51] Are you..do you have any concerns or like any negative&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Olivia [01:55] Things?</p>

<p><strong>James [01:56] Yeah because if the city does like build more parks or if the city builds more housing?</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [02:03] Mmm&#8230; The last buenas&#8230;qué será&#8230;qué más quisiera&#8230;Mmm (what else, what else would i want)</p>

<p><strong>James [02:15] If you can only say it in Spanish, you can say it in Spanish and we can probably translate it later</strong></p>

<p>Olivia [02:23] Y la seguridad, la seguridad alrededor de la ciudad de ciudad (the safety/security, and order in the city(better organization in the city))</p>

<p><strong>James [02:29] okay</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [02:30] Porque si no hay policias, antes si avia pero hay mucho jente y en la noche es dangerous, es peligroso (because there are no policemen, there used to be but there’s a lot of people at night, its dangerous)</p>

<p><strong>James [02:37] okay</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [02:38] Es peligroso (it’s dangerous)</p>

<p><strong>James [02:40] Okay I see, in the river</strong></p>

<p>Olivia [02:41] On the river</p>

<p><strong>James [02:42] Yeah okay and I guess one last question the LA River is like usually used for like when flooding. Are you concerned about flood damage or if they do have development in the in the river, are you concerned about flooding?</strong></p>

<p>Olivia [03:08] Como no e tenido la experiencia, porque allá en Los Ángeles si lo tiene verdad es para pasearse ahi en el río (since i haven’t had the experience, because in los angeles, they have it right, to walk around the River)</p>

<p><strong>James [03:15] okay</strong></p>

<p>Olivia [03:16] No no no sabria decir que es la experiencia (i couldn’t tell you)</p>

<p><strong>James [03:21] okay</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [03:21] Pero si me gustaria (but i would like to)</p>

<p><strong>James [03:23] I see it okay so you like that you haven&#8217;t had any flooding?</strong> </p>

<p>Olivia [03:27] No</p>
