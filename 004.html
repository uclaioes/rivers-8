      <p><strong>South Gate Park (Earth Day Event)</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Kamryn[00:00:00] Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Are you from here?</strong> </p>
      
      <p><strong>Lane</strong>[00:00:00] My name is Lane Robles. I have a troop here in South Gate, in the park. So we do a lot of things for the community of South Gate. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Kamryn[00:00:14] Awesome! And describe your relationship with the river do you have any experiences with the river.</strong> </p>
      
      <p><strong>Lane</strong>[00:00:18] Well we do this [earth day event] every year. And we clean up the edges of the L.A. River. And also we do that for the San Gabriel River and Azusa mountains. We do all that river cleanup. So we take these scouts. What they do is they clean up all, take all that trash. [00:00:34]Break [down] the things that they do without water you know. [3.4s] So we do a lot of stuff with them. We love doing that cleaning with the River, anything to clean. To have a better environment for the boys. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Kamryn[00:00:50] And then what are your thoughts on the current restoration efforts? You know, building things around the river? Have you heard of anything that’s going on?</strong></p>
      
      <p><strong>Lane</strong>[00:00:58] Well the City of South Gate, they’re doing a lot of things for cleaning the river in this area. And actually, today when we were taking out, removing the graffiti, the thing that we saw was there were no more homeless not no more trash. It was nice and clean. Even our scouts were like “Oh it smells good. It doesn’t smell like before. Because they are doing something about it. South Gate is doing something about it. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Kamryn[00:01:25] And the last question what are your thoughts on climate change and flooding in regards to the river?</strong> </p>
      
      <p><strong>Lane</strong>[00:01:37] Flooding especially when it rains here! South Gate it gets pretty bad. That’s because a lot of people, most people don’t care that much and throw things in the river that stuff gets over-flowed. But you see the water coming out of trees and all that trash. But you know like Mother Nature does. It just does. Takes everything away, cleans the river like she wants to have everything clean again. The thing is it goes to the ocean. That’s a bad thing about it. We have to think more about cleaning it up and not throwing thing it in our rivers because a lot of people do that.</p>
