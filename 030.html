  <p><strong>James [00:00:05] I guess you can start off telling us your name
      where you&#8217;re from.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:00:07] Oh really? It&#8217;s got to be like that. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:00:11] Yeah.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:00:11] Why? Well how about we start by you telling me why
    you&#8217;re doing the research. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:00:18] Well we&#8217;re seniors in the environmental
      science program.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:00:22] OK. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:00:22] And. Basically and. I&#8217;m not sure if you know
      the plans about the L.A. River.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:00:30] Yeah they&#8217;re trying to do something there. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:00:33] Essentially.</strong> </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:00:33] Yeah. Right. So. Our research is mostly focused on
      the city of Southgate.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:00:42] OK. Why? Did they give a grant to the UCLA or something or?
  </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:00:47] So basically they&#8217;re having specific
      projects there that are already in the works.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:00:53] I see. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:00:53] And we kind of wanted to do community
      outreach.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:01:00] Right. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:01:00] And see what the community feels about the
      project. Yeah.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:01:05] And what are they proposing down there?</p>

  <p><strong>James [00:01:09] Yeah. So they&#8217;re proposing. Like an urban
      orchard. Some new parks.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:01:15] Urban orchard okay. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:01:18] And then one of the biggest things that they
      haven&#8217;t really released yet is like a project is capping the
      river.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:01:27] Capping? </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:01:28] Yeah.</strong> </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:01:28] Yes. So like covering it and building on top of
      it. So that&#8217;s likely.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:01:36] Isn&#8217;t it like our flood kind of thing? </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:01:39] Yeah.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:01:39] Don&#8217;t they have to maintain it? </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:01:41] Mhm.</strong> </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:01:41] And so that&#8217;s also like another one. Well
      what we&#8217;re looking up is how. How do people view. Like how do people
      respond to the question that. In terms of like future weather
      events.</strong> </p>

  <p>Camila [00:02:00] Yeah. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:02:00] Future weather events and future climate
      instability.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:02:03] Right. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:02:04] Whether they feel that the L.A. River is safe and
      meets up to capacity where they don&#8217;t have a concern about
      flooding.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:02:14] Okay. Gotcha. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:02:18] Yeah.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:02:19] Cool. So. So my name is Alon. And what else would you like
    to know?</p>

  <p><strong>James [00:02:27] I guess. Are you from Southgate?</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:02:31] No. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:02:31] No. OK.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:02:32] I live here in Westwood. </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:02:33] OK.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>James [00:02:35] And um what is your like. How have you used the
      river before? What what is your experience?</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:02:41] For using the bike path to cycle. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:02:47] Do you know like from what area to what
      area</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:02:49] Yeah. All the way up from the top all the way down to the
    bottom. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:02:54] So as long as far as the bike path goes.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>Alon [00:02:56] Yeah because I was training for a bike ride from San
    Francisco to L.A.. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:03:01] Oh wow.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:03:02] So we were going we were using the bike path to train. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:03:07] Yes. So you have heard of some of the
      revitalization efforts. Do you have any thoughts on what you&#8217;ve
      heard so far even from what we&#8217;ve just told you?</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:03:22] Well I&#8217;m all for the people. So whatever plan will
    make sense for most people. I&#8217;m all for it. Obviously maintaining. You
    know if it&#8217;s required to save lives then. Right. I mean if it&#8217;s
    our main flood gates or flood zone thing. So I don&#8217;t have enough
    information on how we use the river and some of the plans. But I heard Gary
    he wants to do something. This and that. But I don&#8217;t have any clear
    idea of what the specifics are. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:03:58] You&#8217;ve used the river and so have there
      been any any things that you would like to see improvement upon.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>Alon [00:04:06] Yeah maybe the homeless situation along the riverbank.
    That&#8217;s very sad. And. Also the like eerie when you arrive and all of a
    sudden somebody is getting out of a tent right under an overpass or
    something like that. So definitely what I saw. That was glaring was this
    idea of the homeless situation. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s specific in
    Southgate. Or. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:04:35] Yeah it seems to kind of be a lot all
      over.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:04:38] Yeah. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:04:40] From what we know from it as well.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:04:44] Is this your first time going to South Gate?</p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:04:49] No.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:04:49] So you&#8217;ve been on it&#8217;s already? </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:04:51] It&#8217;s like our fourth time yet.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:04:51] OK. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:04:52] And I&#8217;m from Downey so.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:04:54] I see so you know that area. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:04:55] Yeah yeah.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:04:58] So what are your thoughts on what should happen. Obviously
    you&#8217;re learning it. You&#8217;re a little bit more in depth. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:05:03] Yeah.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:05:04] What do you think. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:05:05] Definitely not for capping.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:05:08] Yeah capping sounds a little. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:05:08] It hurts me a little bit.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:05:12] Okay, why? Share with me why please. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:05:17] It&#8217;s just. We have this rsource.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>Alon [00:05:23] Right. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:05:25] And as humans we have this consistent desire to
      control everything. And just like manipulate things and make things worse.
      That&#8217;s what it feels like what is going on with the river.
      Especially by capping and not thinking about flood risk and things like
      that. At this point it&#8217;s too late to take out concrete. I really
      feel like we have too many people living by the edge of the
      river.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:06:00] Okay. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:06:01] Too many. Too much housing. And businesses. And
      at this point we can&#8217;t move those people back. Really. unless we
      have this huge ordeal thing or something. And so we can&#8217;t take out
      the concrete. So let&#8217;s not make things worse by like capping it. I
      think that.</strong> </p>

  <p><strong>James [00:06:26] For me I think I would want to see like an actual
      like natural river. And it may not be possible now to do that. Feels like
      in the future. Yeah. So. Like. Capping the river I would definitely like
      put a nail in the coffin.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:06:46] So that&#8217;s probably the worst option. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:06:48] Right.</strong> </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:06:49] The thing for me is I think that means
      maintaining the areas that do have the natural.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:06:57] Around it. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:06:57] Yeah and I understand the need or the desire for
      parks and orchards. I think that&#8217;s great because not only are you
      building more green spaces in a community that some people perceive that
      they need it but you are also using the river as like. It introduces
      people to the river that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s there or
      wouldn&#8217;t think about it.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:07:23] Like an attraction. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:07:25] Yeah several of our interviews were like
      &#8220;why would we go there? There&#8217;s nothing to do.&#8221; Like
      there&#8217;s so. Building parks or building an orchard like that can
      definitely change that.</strong></p>

  <p>Alon [00:07:42] Well good luck. This is important. </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:07:44] Thank you.</strong> </p>

  <p>Alon [00:07:45] When are you guys graduating? </p>

  <p><strong>Camila [00:07:46] June.</strong> </p>
